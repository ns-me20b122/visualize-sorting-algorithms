# Sorting Visualizer

Fascinated with Data Structures and various sorting algorithms?!!

Well, welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This application was created out of my fascination with sorting algorithms and the desire to provide a dynamic visualization of their functionality. I hope you find as much enjoyment in exploring and interacting with this visualization tool as I did when developing it. To experience it firsthand, please access the Sorting Visualizer [here](https://sorting-visualizer-9474.web.app).

This web application provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe how different algorithms work and understand their sorting efficiency. The following sorting algorithms are visualized in this application:

- Bubble Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

Each algorithm is implemented as an asynchronous function that takes an array of DOM element objects as a parameter and sorts these elements in-place, in ascending order. The visualization is achieved using custom-documented APIs for rendering and color-coding, making it easier to follow the sorting process step by step.
